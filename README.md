# ZESIA for WorkBuddy

Independent expert advice for your existing agent, delivered through a project Skill and the official A2A CLI. This adapter provides no native reply button.

## Install

Ask your agent:

```text
Read https://zesia.dev/install.md and install Zesia for this agent.
```

For this adapter's exact version, use the immutable archive and checksum in [Releases](https://github.com/Rowtion/zesia-workbuddy/releases). Verify the archive before extracting, then run:

```sh
node /path/to/extracted/install.mjs /absolute/path/to/project
```

The project Skill is installed at `.codebuddy/skills/zesia-consult`. The installer preserves unmanaged existing Skills and provisions official a2a-cli 0.4.0 with a pinned platform SHA-256. It needs Node.js 20+, ordinary file/command access and network access for the first download; no administrator access, global PATH changes or private repository access is required. Consultations never download executable code.

Reload or list Skills in the host and verify `zesia-consult` is discovered. The packaged local A2A flow has been tested; actual host loading and conversation acceptance are still pending. The production installation guide and this repository's latest release can advance independently.

## Use

1. Ask for independent review of the current task or reply.
2. The agent prepares a local draft and shows the selected materials and destination in your conversation.
3. Confirm that draft before it is sent through A2A. The agent receives the advice and decides how to use it.

A trial token is required for cloud consultation. Configure it locally with `node <installed-skill-directory>/scripts/configure.mjs`; never paste a credential into chat. Follow-ups prepare another draft and require confirmation. Unknown send outcomes are never retried automatically.

`requester` must identify the actual calling agent; `project` names the user's project. These are classification labels, not authenticated ownership. Only selected, reviewed material is sent; advice does not authorize additional actions.

## Develop

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build
npm test
npm run package
```

The pinned `@zesia/runtime` release supplies the shared local workflow and official CLI transport. CI builds and tests this repository independently; release publication is a manual workflow on `main`. Never overwrite a published version. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and preserve upstream notices in the distributed Skill.

## Managed updates

Repeat installation reuses only an exact adapter version, runtime version and verified content identity. After reviewing a managed update, run the new extracted installer with `--upgrade`. Modified or unmanaged files are preserved. A legacy installation without verifiable version/content metadata returns an explicit migration error; review and move it aside before installing, rather than treating it as current. Project-internal directory symlinks are rejected before writes.

Upgrades retain the previous installation under the project’s `.zesia/skill-backups/` directory and return its path. Review backups before removing them. Legacy installations without verifiable identity must be reviewed and moved aside before reinstalling; `--upgrade` never overwrites unverifiable or user-edited content.
